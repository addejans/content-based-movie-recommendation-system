# Movie Recommendation System

This project uses Flask to deploy a content-based movie recommendation system. Provide a movie title and 10 recommended movies based on this title will be provided. Don't know the exact movie title? The application will give suggestions based on your spelling. 


### What is the importance of deploying this project end-to-end?
  - Deployment is often an overlooked phase from many theoretical data scientists.
  - In order to start using a model for practical decision-making, it needs to be effectively deployed into production. If you cannot reliably get practical insights from your model, then the impact of the model is severely limited.
  - In order to get the most value out of machine learning models, it is important to seamlessly deploy them into production so a business can start using them to make practical decisions.

   <h3 class="tab"> Importance of recommendation systems?</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
         <li>Companies like Amazon, Netflix, Linkedin, and Pandora leverage recommender systems to help users discover new and relevant items (products, videos, jobs, music), creating a delightful user experience while driving incremental revenue.</li>
      </ul>
   <h3 class="tab"> What is a Content Based Recommender? </h3>
   <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li> A content based recommender works with data that the user provides, either explicitly (rating) or 
         implicitly (clicking on a link). Based on that data, a user profile is generated, which is then used 
         to make suggestions to the user. As the user provides more inputs or takes actions on the recommendations, 
         the engine becomes more and more accurate.
      </li>
      <li> Users or items have profiles describing their characteristics and the 
         system would recommend an item to a user if the two profiles match.
      </li>
      <li> Content-based methods are computationally fast and interpretable. They can be easily adapted to new items or new 
         users. However, some characteristics of items/users may not be easy to capture or describe explicitly.
      </li>
   </ul>
